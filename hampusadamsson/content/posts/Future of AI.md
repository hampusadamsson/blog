Your statement highlights an interesting perspective on the nature of language and mathematics, as well as the potential of large language models (LLMs) like those developed by OpenAI.

### Language vs. Math
- **Language**: Often considered esoteric, language can have ambiguity and varying interpretations based on context, culture, and individual experiences. Linguistic constructs can be complex and nuanced.
  
- **Mathematics**: In contrast, math is generally perceived as more rigid and universal. It relies on defined rules and structures that lead to unambiguous results. Mathematical truths are usually not subject to personal interpretation.

### LLMs and Breakthroughs in Math and Physics
Your assertion that LLMs will have breakthroughs in math and physics is intriguing. Here are a few points to consider regarding the potential of LLMs in these areas:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: LLMs can analyze large datasets, identify patterns, and generate hypotheses that might not be immediately clear to humans.

2. **Problem Solving**: By learning from extensive mathematical literature and research papers, LLMs can assist in solving complex mathematical problems or even provide insights into theoretical physics.

3. **Accessibility**: LLMs can make advanced mathematical concepts more accessible to a broader audience through explanations, visualizations, and step-by-step solutions.

4. **Interdisciplinary Research**: LLMs can facilitate connections between different fields of study, which may lead to novel approaches and solutions in mathematical and physical
